Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Project
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced AI technique that enhances the capabilities of language models by integrating retrieval-based search with generative AI. Traditional language models generate responses based solely on pre-trained knowledge, which may become outdated or lack domain-specific details. RAG solves this by dynamically retrieving relevant information from an external database, document repository, or vector store before generating a response.

This project leverages LlamaIndex, Azure AI Search, and OpenAI models to create a powerful RAG system that can efficiently search, retrieve, and generate insightful responses based on up-to-date information.

Key Features
Hybrid AI Approach – Combines retrieval-based search with generative AI for more accurate responses.
Scalability – Uses Azure AI Search for indexing large-scale documents efficiently.
Integration with LlamaIndex – A powerful framework for document indexing and querying.
Customizable Knowledge Base – Works with structured and unstructured data sources.
Dynamic Information Retrieval – Ensures responses are based on the latest available data.
